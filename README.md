Android application that helps sending SMS linked with the other application: https://github.com/Quent1V/quentin-au-perou

In order to send SMS to your correct Twilio member, replace the value of "YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER" called with sendTextMessage in MainActivity.java

Known issues:
- sometimes the SMS is not sent, I don't know exactly why but it happens.
- the GPS coordinates are not always retrieved properly
